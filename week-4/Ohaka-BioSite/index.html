                    <b >WHAT DEFINES MY PERSONALITY?</b>
                    <br/>
                    I have an inquisitive mind which leads me to wanting to figure out how things work-- whether it be in politics, technology, music etc
                    <br/>
                    <b>WHAT ARE MY FAVORITE FOODS?</b>
                    <br/>
                    Currently I'd have to say Bulgogi is my favorite dish. I am a big fan of asian dishes
                    <br/>
                    <b>WHAT TALENTS DO I HAVE?</b>
                    <br/>
                    I would say the defining talent i have is in illustrating and painting. Ive been an artist for as long as I remember and being a graphic design as a career was pretty obvious at an early age
